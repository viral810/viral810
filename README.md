**Hi, I'm Viral.**

I am Software Engineer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I love working with Ruby programming language but I consider myself a Polyglot engineer since I've worked with variety of programming languages. My second favourite language is Javascript. I love working on software products to make life easier for everyone. I like databases, distributed systems, cloud computing and machine learning.
